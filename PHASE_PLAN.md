## Critical Implementation Notes

### Railway Deployment Necessity
Twilio requires public HTTPS webhooks for call events, making local development insufficient. Railway provides:
- Instant HTTPS endpoints for Twilio webhooks
- WebSocket support for real-time dashboard updates
- Environment variable management
- Automatic deployments from Git repositories

### Real-time Architecture
- Socket.io handles live call status updates between dashboard users
- Redis stores temporary call state and user sessions
- PostgreSQL maintains persistent user and call history data

### Security Considerations
- All Twilio credentials remain server-side only
- JWT tokens for frontend authentication
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting for API protection

### Scalability Design
- Stateless server design for horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling
- Efficient WebSocket connection management
- Optimized drag/drop performance for large user lists

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Sub-2 second call connection times
- [ ] Real-time dashboard updates (<100ms latency)
- [ ] 99.9% call success rate
- [ ] Responsive UI on all devices
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployments

- TwiML provides call routing, parking, and transfer capabilities
- Real-time call events via webhooks (requires public HTTPS endpoints)
- Supports conference calls, IVR systems, and call monitoring

#### Railway Platform Benefits
- Instant HTTPS endpoints for Twilio webhook integration
- WebSocket support for real-time applications
- Automatic Node.js deployment with package.json detection
- Built-in environment variable management
- Docker-based builds with fast deployment cycles

#### Drag & Drop Library Comparison
- **dnd-kit**: Modern, accessible, performant (recommended for complex dashboards)
- **React Grid Layout**: Specialized for grid-based layouts (ideal for user cards)
- **React Beautiful DnD**: Best for list-based layouts (Kanban style)
- **React DnD**: Most flexible but complex API

#### Tech Stack Rationale
- **React over Vue**: Larger ecosystem, better long-term support, Meta backing
- **TypeScript**: Better development experience and code reliability
- **PostgreSQL over MongoDB**: ACID compliance for financial/call data
- **Socket.io**: Most mature WebSocket library with broad browser support
